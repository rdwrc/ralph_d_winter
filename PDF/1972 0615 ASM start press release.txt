MISSIOLOGISTS FORM SOCIETY

I NASHVILLE, TENNESSEEw~The American Society of Missiology, an organization

Plbringing together professors of mission and others interested in studying the

u missionary dimension of the Christian Church, was formally proposed June 9e10, in

an ad~hoc gathering at Scarritt College for-Christian Workers in Nashville. The
45 who attended the meeting approved a statement of purpose and named a continuam
tion committee to draft a constitution, solicit additional members, publish a news»

letter, explore the feasibility of launching a scholarly journal, and call a con~

stituent assembly set for June 8«lO, 1973.

 

The new organization is not intended to take over the fuhetiuns of two as
ing groups with similar purposes: The Association of Professors of Mission sad
the more~recent Association of Evangelical Professors of Mission, The presidents

of both, James Pyke oi Wesley Theological Seminary and Herbert Kane of Trinity
Evangelical Divinity School participated in the meeting and joined the A,S.M" as
charter members.

Ferhaps the key issue of debate concerned the purpose. Some felt that the
A.S.M. should declare as its goal the fulfillment of the Great Commission, others
‘that it should fix as its end the study of missiology but without doctrinal over~
tones, thus bringing itself more into line with the outlook of the American Council
of Learned Societies. As the discussion progressed, the participants, who repre«
sented conservative evangelicals, ecumenicals, and Roman Catholics, reached the
mutual agreement that the A.S.M. should be strictly academic. The conservatives
in particular expressed their feeling that only as such could they continue to

participate,

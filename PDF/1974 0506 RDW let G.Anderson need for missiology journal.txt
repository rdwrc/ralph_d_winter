Dear Jerry:

It seems to me that instead of defending ourselves
on this point we ought to go on the offense and try
to recruit outstanding scholars already well«estab—
lished in those other disciplines to write for our
journal. I'm sure than in a sense this is what Alan
Tippett is doing, but I wonder if we couldn't our-
selves take aim on certain significant scholars who
are well—known and curry their favor toward the idea
of their writing something that they happen to know
about that falls into the area of interest which we
call missiology.

I wonder if you are as exercised as I am about the
need for a program someplace, anyplace, which will
give an honest—to—goodness Ph.D. in the field of
missiology itself. Can a scholarly community long
survive and the discipline representing that area

of concern long continue if in fact the people do-
ing the work are constantly being borrowed forever
from nearby fields? Isn‘t it necessary to go be-
yond the Hartford model which in a sense borrowed
from other fields and then meekly submitted to the
slaughter when people in those other areas decided
the time was up? Have you been doing any thinking
along this line, Jerry? I wonder if you couldn't

get a foot in the door at Yale and work along with
Charles Forman to develop a Ph.D. in missiology

there? I don't believe everybody has to go to Fuller.
If you could pick up James Scherer and part of Beaver's
time and some of the other key people in our Society

wouldn't one of those universities back there be will-
ing to buy into this? What's the use of talking

about the missiologieal curriculum as they were doing
in that committee at Milligan if we don't have the
institutional muscle to promote it?

Do let me have your thoughts about this as soon as
you can.

Yours very cordially,

Ralph D. Winter

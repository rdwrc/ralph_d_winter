Dear fellow missioiogist:

I. The names on the following pages indicate the response
to the March 22nd letter. Asterisks indicate those who are
planning to attend the June 9, l0 meeting.

2. Those who cannot attend will be kept informed if they have ”
asked us to do so.

3. Those who plan to attend should note thatithe address of
the Scarritt College is l9th Avenue South at Grand, but they should
mail their SZJGO registration and $8.00 lodging-and-(3)-meals just
to the name of the college as follows: ' '

Scarritt College for Christian workers
Nashville, Tennessee 37203

(Use of the street address in mailing apparently slows things up.)
If you would like to bring along a spouse, add an additional $8.00
for lodging and the three meals. Make your check out to Scarritt
College, write on the check “Lodging and meals, ASH conference
June 9, l0“ since there are a lot of conferences going on there

this summer.

#. This is the last letter that will be sent out on this basis.
Let me personally explain once more that I have been acting merely as
the amanuensis for a small_group who have for over a year and a half

been talking about the need for this type of society. Now there is
a larger group who will be talking together June 9th and lOth and

my little chore will be over.

Cordially,

Ralph D, grater
_ RDN/p

P:S. In case you have misplaced the March 22 letter, the meeting
will best" with supper at 5:30 P.M. on Friday,June 9th and terminate
with lunch on Saturday, June l0th. More of these March 22 letters

are available from my office.

Missions Fest ~ 2010

A Tribute to

Dr. Ralph Winter 1924-2009

Richard Dodding

I learned much of my missiology from Dr.
Ralph Winter. We ﬁrst met at our second
Missions Fest, in Ianuary1985 when he
joined other plenary speakers such as Elis-
abeth Elliott, Paul Kaufman and George
Cowan. He didn’t seem to be a ﬂamboyant
speaker, but was Very thoughtful and full
of ideas I had not yet contemplated. Having
served as a missionary, I remember form-
ing my own unique ideas of how I thought
missions should be accomplished, so to read
Dr. Winter’s innovative commentaries mo-
tivated me to look further.

As we began developing Missions Fest I
was always eager to learn more about the
many aspects of mission I
had not yet considered. To
my surprise, I discovered a
thin, little, unimpressive—
looking magazine printed
on newsprint without
glossy coloured pages. It
contained eight to twelve
articles dealing with cur-
rent trends and practice
in mission, and many
thought—provoking ideas
of mission beyond the
norm. I also discovered
that the magazine was free for a donation.
I began subscribing. Over the years, Mission
Frontiers became one of the chief sources of
my mission education. For example, it was
here that that I learned about identiﬁable,
hidden people groups who had never heard
of Jesus. I discovered that one way to reach
them would be for churches and organiza-
tions to work together by adopting them.

As Editor—in—Chief of Mission Frontiers,
Ralph Winter invited many other writers to
submit challenging articles. "Ihey contained
an unending stream of themes necessary
to consider for anyone giving leadership in
missions. It was here that I learned about
the Perspectives on the World Christian
Movement, a 16-week course that ﬁnally
arrived in Greater Vancouver in 1993, co-
ordinated by Margo Hoffman. She and her
team had invited Ralph Winter along with
Don Richardson and other notables, to pro-
vide the lectures.

Since one of the goals of Missions Fest is
provide information about needs around the

 

world and opportunities to serve, we needed
to ﬁnd affordable, pertinent information
useful to our churches and leaders. We dis-
covered yet another valuable, resource: the
William Carey Library~—another initiative
of Ralph Winter. For many years, the Mis-
sions Fest website has provided a direct link
to these books.

Many were the achievements of Dr.
Winter. He was a man ahead of his time.
For instance, while serving as a mission-
ary in Guatemala for ten years, he not only
taught missiology in the local university, he
helped the poor peasants begin their own
industries and businesses so that they could
support both themselves
and their churches. It was
later that he saw his dream
fulﬁlled to have a campus
where mission specialists
and organizations would
work side by side: the US
Center for World Mission.
His “wartime lifestyle” re-
ally caught my attention.
Rumour has it that he
never bought a new suit.
He didn’t talk about it, or
expect others to adopt his
ways, but he encouraged sacrifice for the
sake of the ministry. His was a lifestyle of
sacriﬁce and frugality, yet far ahead in the
use of technology for the sake of the king-
dom of God. It was demonstrated in the
newsprint magazine, Mission Frontiers,
that was affordable for everyone, and now is
carefully stored on the Internet so that all
these past articles can be downloaded free
of charge.

Dr. Winter was a revolutionary for his
time, and gathered like-minded people
around him. He inﬂuenced my vision for
Missions Fest and he will continue to inﬂu-
ence many in the years to come. We shall
always be thankful to God for this life that
was surrendered to God, living the abun-
dant life to the day he was called Home. ﬂ

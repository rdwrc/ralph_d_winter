Dear Ralph:

The MRL directors deoided againstwmgﬂger oF the OE With

MISSIDLUEY, at least For the time being. The announcement
oF a merger which appeared in a reoent issue ot the DB
was a “Fluke.” I think they want to wait and see 4-B

issues oF MISSIDLQGY BEFGRE eewmeaeiwextwemx committing
themselves.

It is indeed distressing that our subscribers will be
luoky iF they get the April issue oF MISSIULDGY by
Christmas. Could a WggggﬁmggmigsggtggkiﬂtgﬂNo. 3
explaining that this is due to an "act oF God" and
not the Fault oF the editor? Could you rush me some
copies oF No. 2 as soon as they arrive? Also, I am

a1m°%ElE£EJdL£aaeeeoe:v~ eea—~ﬂN5ew

I think it is very important under the oiroumstanoes,
as you suggests 130 eend E! SP}i'ﬂ§l.t.iD,s!!.alueEE,.:‘?,'‘'‘ 30 the
ohartermembers, explaining onoe again the understanding
abnut $10 contribution For ohareermembership, plus

$8 For subscription, and explaining the delay in
publication oF the gxan journal. Also, var important,

in this newsletter please give preliminarx announoement

about the next ABM meeting, dune 7M9 at Wheaton College.
You could get some preliminary details about the
program From Walter Cason in Naperville. The program
oommittee has met twioe and has the outline ot the

subjeots and sessions.

I have an article coming out soon in CHRISTIAN CENTURY

interest to you and your oolleaguee.

This year at Cornell is a real toniol

F fTheHnatter_of_the Journal was fully discussed by the Provisional
Committee at its meeting at Alverna,‘Netherlands, November 1970
(the only-meeting which, for financial and other reasons it has
been able to hold). It was agreed ”(a) that Professor Myklebust

be the association‘s editor, (b) that the Provisional Committee

constitute an interim editorial board; Cc) that Mrs
Messrs,

__ _President Anderson raises the question of possibly putting the

lpillthinks that it is worth investigating what have been the e _« tr”
;experiences of journals, such as the "International Review of '

"Mission9, which appear entirely in English. As regards contents
H'the suggestion is made that the last issue or, alternatively and

preferably, a special number each year be devoted to an annual

bibliographical review or survey of mission literature.

Professor Camps, finally, has specially interested himself in the

name of the proposed journal. Of the titles suggested by the

secretary he prefers “Acts Missiologica”, “Journal of Missiology”

or “International Journal of Mission Studies“, too, are good

       

  

   

titles, as the word Ujournal” indicates a scientific publication,

On the otherhand ”Studia Missionaria" cannot be accepted, as there
exists in Rome a review entitled ”Studia Missionalia”, and “Missioﬂ

Se-far_the_re~actions received to the memorandum of April 15,
5_C.’1972. Some additional remarks concerning some of the points raised
"‘there:follow.~_ '
1. The question of finding a publisher has occupied the members
: of the committee ever since its meeting at Alverna.in November 1970,
but until April this year no answer had been found. Even now we do “
not see clearly our way in this matter. However, the situation is . ’
not without hopeful features. As far as publisher is concerned, Dr.
- Walls, who has investigated the possibilities which Britain offers,
- 3 reports that Messrs Maroham Manor Press are interested, but would

e_totmake.enguiries..Brill‘s are definitely interested, In the" ;u:'
' words.or the birector,'Mr,{Wieddr, "such a journal would fit in _ W
with the character of our firm". However, because of the difficult“ .
economic situationgthey can undertake to publish the journal_onl§7ti~
on condition that a;subsidy_be guaranteed. They publish about H0
scientific journais._Of these-only three are selfusupporting.
‘ ‘In the report of his conversation with Director Wieder on June
722, 1972, Professor Jansen Schoonhoven also has this to say: : MW“

"Thinking of a journal that appears in u issues a year, of 80 _ '9 "”
I pages each, the subscription fee would become 60—8O Dutch guilders,
”7which of course is far too high,'It would have to be reduced to
I 30~HO Dutch guilders. Mr, Wieder assumed that a yearly subsidy of

15;-20.000 Dutch guilders would be necessary, at least in the

first three years, If the number of subscribers would increase

above-expectations, the subsidy could be diminished,”
2= EiH§§£9s "

 
     
  

   

 
      
 

    
 
   
 
 

    

   

 

This is, of course, our main problem, and it is
therefore imperative that a satisfactory solution to it he found,
By pooling our resources as«a world fellowship we ought to be able
to raise the funds required, If a subsidy of 20.000 Dutch guilders
will be needed, 50 per cent of this amount might be paid in the
form of contributions from institutional members {which would mean
that, on the basis of the present corporate membership, each
institution on an average would pay 250 Dutch guilders), and the
50 per cent through contributions from scientific

foundations, councils, etc, in the several countries as well as
from

remaining

special bodies such as the Sacra Congregatio pro Gentium'
Evangelizatione in Rome and the Evangelische Arbeitsgemeinschaft
fur Weltmission in Hamburg. A number of the leading missionary,
boards and societies in the USA and Europe,

too, might be approached
with.a View to enlisting their support,

To reduce production costs the number of issues a year may be

out down from four to three (of 80 pages each),.and further,

although we hesitate to suggest this, the number of pages in each

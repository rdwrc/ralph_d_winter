Files in the "PDF" folder have been run thru the "image_to_text" script to
create text files that match the images in the PDF files. These text files
need to be edited to make sure they match the original files.

In order to run the "image_to_text" script you must have the following installed
locally on your computer:

1) tesseract-ocr : http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr
2) image magick : http://www.imagemagick.org
